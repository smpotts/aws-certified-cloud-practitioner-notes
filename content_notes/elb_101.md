# Building a Web Server & Using an Elastic Load Balancer

## In terminal
- ssh to EC2
- sudo su
- yum update -y
- install a program to make ec2 instance a web server
- yum install httpd -y
- service httpd start
- cd /var/www/html
- ls >> nothing in there
- nano index.html >> make a little web page

In web browser
- paste public ip address

## Using An Elastic Load Balancer LAB
- Application Load Balancers are application aware
- Network load balancers are for static ip addresses and extremely high performance

VPC - virtual data center in the cloud

## Create a new web server
- make a note of which AZ instance is in
- create a new instance but make the AZ different from the first one
- in advanced details, add a boostrap script that runs as the instance boots

### Script to add:
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
service httpd start
chkcongif on
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><body><h1>Hello Cloud Gurus</h1></body></html>" > index.html

Copy the public ip and put it in the browser to view the web page

To test Load Balancer
- Copy DNS name, and now you can use that to resolve to the EC2 instance

## Add EC2 instance behind load balancer
- Target Groups
- Targets
- You will see the first instance
- Add to registered instances and click on the new one
- Copy DNS and paste in browser
- Delete the WebServer 2
- Now refreshing will give you just one of them

## Exam tips
- Load balancers in 3 flavors
- Application load balancers - layer 7 aware, about to make intelligent decisions
- Network load balancers - extreme performance or static ip address
- classic load balancer - test and dev or keep costs low
- EC2 instances in different AZ zones
