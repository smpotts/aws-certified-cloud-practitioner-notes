# EC2 101

## What is EC2?
- Elastic Compute Cloud
- Virtual server or servers in the cloud. Reduces time to boot and take down new servers

## EC2 Pricing Model
1. On Demand : fixed rate by the hour or second with no committment
2. Reserved : 1/3 year contracts, cheaper the more you put down up front, charged hourly 
3. Spot : bid a price you want to pay and provisions when it hits, when price is below you lose the server. Applications where you don't have to worry about losing your servers
4. Dedicated Hosts : physical EC2 servers dedicated to you. Allows you to use server bound licenses

## Use cases
1. On Demand
- want low cost and flexibility without contracts, upfront payments
- applications with short term spiky or unpredictable workloads
- cannot be interrupted
- applications being developed or tested for the first time

2. Reserved
- steady state predictable usage
- make upfront payments to reduce total computing costs
- the longer the contract the cheaper it is

3. Spot
- applications with flexible start and end times
- applications only feasible for very low compute prices

4. Dedicated Hosts
- regulatory requirements that do not allow multitenant virtualization
- licensing that does not allow multitenant deployments
- dedicated hosts on demand and hourly

## Reserved Instance Types
1. Standard Reserved Instances - more you pay upfront and longer the contract the greater discounts you get
2. Convertible Reserved Instances - able to change the attributes of the reserved instance as long as you change to something of equal or greater value
3. Scheduled Reserved Instances - schedule reserved instances between time windows

## EC2 Instance Types
Mnemonic: Fight Dr Mc Pxz Au
F - FPGA
I - IOPS
G - Graphics
H - High Disk throughput
T - T2 micro

D - density
R - RAM

M - Main choice gen purpose
C - Compute
P - Graphics Pics
X - Extreme memory
Z - Extreme memory and cpu

A - arm based workloads
U - bare metal

## What is EBS?
- EBS is the virtual hard disks that ECS uses. Creates storage volumes and attaches them to ECS instancs. 
- can install OS
- run a database
- automatically replicated
- in a particular AV zone and must be in the same one as ECS

## EBS Types
1. SSD 
	a. General Purpose SSD(GP2) - balances price and performance for a wide variety of workloads
	b. Provisioned IOPS SSD(IO1) - highest performance SSD volume for mission critical low latency or high throughput workloads
2. Magnetic
	a. Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1) - low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed throughput intensive workloads
	b. Cold HDD (SC1) - low cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads (file servers)
	c. Magnetic - previous generation

## Exam Tips
- EC2 is a virtual server in cloud
- ECS2 has 4 pricing models
- Popular question: what happens if spot instance is terminated by EC2? you are not charged for partial hour of usage. but if you terminate the instance you are changed for the hour the instance ran.
- remember the instance types mnemonic FIGHT DR MCPXZ AU
- remember 4 different EBS volume types

Firewall - enable communication through different ports
To let everything in 0.0.0.0/0
Let just one IP in x.x.x.x/32 where public ip is x.x.x.x


## Add storage is EBS
- In the terminal
- In the Downloads folder
- chmod 400 pem file
- ssh ec2-user@public_ip -i MyPrivateKey.pem
- type yes
- You are on the EC2 instance

#### In AWS console
- Security Groups
- Make sure port 22 is open for WebDMZ

#### Back to terminal
sudo su
yum update -y

## Exam Tips
- EC2 compute based. Actual virtual server
- Use a private key to connect to EC2
- Linux port ssh port 22, windows RDP 3389, HTTP 80, HTTPS 443
- security groups are virtual firewalls
- everything in 0.0.0.0/0
- one in public ip/0
- should have an EC2 instance in 2 AZs
