# S3 101
## What is S3?
- place to put flat files: pictures, videos, files that do not change
- safe place to store files
- object based storage
- data is spread across mulitple devices and facilities
- allows you to upload 0 bytes to 5 TB
- files are stored in buckets
- there is unlimited storage

## The Basics
- share a universal namespace meaning they must be unique globally
- creates a website url
- always going to receive http 200 code upon success
- bucket policies are used on the entire bucket
- access control lists are used on objects

## Objects
- objects are file and consist of 1) the key ie the name of the document 2) the value ie the data that makes up the object
- version id
- meta data about the data it's storing
- sub-resources : access control lists and torrent

## How does data consistency work?
- Read after write for PUTS of new objects
- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES
- if you put a file in S3 and read it immediately, you will be able to view that data
- if you are updating an existing file or delete a file you may be able to reach the older version. The changes take a little bit to propagate

## S3 Guarantees
- Built for 99.99% availability
- Amazon guarantees 99.9% availability

## S3 Features
- Tiered storage
- Lifecycle management
- Versioning
- Encryption
- Access control lists and bucket policies

## Storage classes
1. S3 Standard
2. S3 Infrequently accessed - lower fee than s3 and charged a retrieval fee
3. S3 One Zone IA - only one availability zone for infrequently accessed
4. S3 Intelligent Tiering - can move the files based on your usage to cheaper tiers
5. Glacier - Even cheaper. charged for retrieval. retrieval from minutes to hours
6. Glacier Deep Archive - retrieval of 12 hours acceptable. Cheapest. Charged for retrieval.

## S3 Charges
- storage
- requests
- storage management pricing
- data transfer pricing
- transfer acceleration
- cross region replication pricing

### Transfer acceleration
Uses edge locations to accelerate transfer of files across a long distance by caching with edge locations

### Cross Region replication
Bucket automatically syncs with another bucket in another region

## Exam Tips
- s3 object based
- 0 bytes to 5 TB
- unlimited
- files in buckets
- universal namespace
- http s3 region amazon then bucket name
- cannot install OS on it
- successful uploads return http 200
- key (name) value (data) pair
- when you put a new file you can read immediately
- if it exists it can take time to propagate
- remember 6 storage classes
