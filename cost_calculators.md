## AWS Calculators
- AWS helps you calculate your costs using a couple of different calculators
	1. AWS Simple Monthly Calculator : allows you to estimate and calculate your costs
	2. AWS Total Cost of Ownership Calculator : allows you to compare the cost of doing things in the cloud in AWS vs on prem
