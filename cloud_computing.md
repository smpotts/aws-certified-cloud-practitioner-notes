# Cloud Computing
## What is it?
Basically renting someone else's computer to do processing, storage etc

## 6 Advantages of Cloud Computing
1. Trade capital expense for variable expense - instead of inventing in data centers you pay for what you consume
2. Benefit from AWS purchasing power to get the equipment they need
3. Never worry about buying too much or too little
4. Increase speed and agility
5. Stop spending money managing infrastructure
6. Go global in minutes

## Types of Cloud Computing
1. Infrastructure as a service - basically AWS. Managing the servers and data center
2. Platform as a service (PAAS) - someone else manages the underlying hardware and OS. You focus on the app
3. Software as a service (SAAS) - all you do it worry about software and company manages literally everything else

## Types of Cloud Computing Deployments
1. Public cloud - AWS, Azure, GCP
2. Hybrid - both private and public
3. Private cloud or on prem

# Around The World With AWS

Availability zone vs region - availability zone as a "data center", building that is filled with servers. May actually be several data centers (one or more). Region is a geographical area.

Edge Locations - endpoints for AWS to cache content using CloudFront and Amazon Content Delivery Network to deliver content

## Exam Tips
- Region is geographical and consists of two or more availability zones
- Availability zone is one ore more data centers
- Edge locations are endpoints for AWS to cache content
- Why you should choose a region 1) data soverignty laws - data can only reside in a particular country 2) Latency to end users 3) AWS Services - not all services are available in all the regions
